          My name is Mohammed Chisti and I am a Software Developer based in New
          York City, NY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look around. I have built this website to help me both document
          and share the things I continue to learn as a developer. If you like
          my work, feel free to reach out, I am for hire. Or drop a "Hello" too.

          Disclaimer: This website is still not where I want it to be yet and
          therefore still being polished. If you find any bugs, I would greatly
          appreciate it if you would bring them up to me. Thank you!
